🏥 TokenMitra — Clinic Appointment & Token Automation System

TokenMitra is a web app built using the MERN stack that helps small clinics manage patient appointments efficiently.
Instead of visiting the clinic twice just to collect a token and then meet the doctor later, users can now:

✨ Book a slot/token online
✨ Check doctor availability in real-time
✨ find the specific doctor they need
✨ View estimated visit time
✨ Track their appointment status
✨ Receive auto-generated token via email or dashboard
✨ Realtime chat with the Doctor and many more...

The goal is to replace manual token queues with a simple, digital solution - saving time for both patients and clinic staff.

🎯 Why this project?

In many small towns, patients still have to:

1️⃣ Visit the clinic early morning
2️⃣ Stand in a queue to get a token
3️⃣ Return again later when the doctor arrives

This app automates the whole process with just a few taps.
